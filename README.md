## what is this repo?
### short answer 

nothing much just a collection of nice looking shiny stuff I found online or just new things I decided to play around with a little.

### notes to self
1. **adding a git submodule**
```bash
git submodule add -f -- <remoteUrl> <local/repo/path>
```
2. **setting upstream branch as default tracking branch**
```bash
git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/master master
```
